### Pytest Configuration (`conftest.py`)

The test configuration includes:

- **Fixtures**: Reusable test data and mock objects
- **Markers**: Test categorization (unit, integration, e2e, performance, security)
- **Database Setup**: In-memory SQLite for testing
- **Mock Services**: Comprehensive mocking of external dependencies
- **Async Support**: Full async/await support for all tests

### Coverage Configuration

```python
# Coverage targets
COVERAGE_TARGET = 85.0  # Minimum coverage percentage
COVERAGE_REPORTS = [
    "term-missing",     # Terminal output
    "html",             # HTML report
    "xml"               # XML report for CI/CD
]
```

## Test Data and Fixtures

### Sample Data Fixtures

```python
# Sample investigation data
sample_investigation_data = {
    "title": "Test Investigation",
    "description": "Test investigation for comprehensive testing",
    "target": "test-target.com",
    "platforms": ["twitter", "github", "reddit"],
    "priority": "medium",
    "status": "active"
}

# Sample social media data
sample_social_media_data = {
    "platform": "twitter",
    "username": "test_user",
    "profile": {
        "username": "test_user",

        "followers_count": 1000,
        "verified": False
    },
    "posts": [...]
}
```

### Mock Services

All external services are mocked to ensure:
- **Isolation**: Tests don't depend on external services
- **Reliability**: Tests are not affected by network issues
- **Speed**: Tests run quickly without external calls
- **Control**: Predictable test scenarios

## Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions Example

```yaml
name: Comprehensive Tests
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: 3.9
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          pip install pytest pytest-asyncio pytest-cov
      - name: Run tests
        run: python tests/run_tests.py
      - name: Upload coverage
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v1
```

## Best Practices

### Writing Tests

1. **Test Naming**: Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
2. **Test Isolation**: Each test should be independent and not rely on other tests
3. **Mock External Dependencies**: Always mock external services and APIs
4. **Test Data**: Use realistic but minimal test data
5. **Error Scenarios**: Test both success and failure scenarios

### Test Organization

1. **Arrange**: Set up test data and mocks
2. **Act**: Execute the code being tested
3. **Assert**: Verify the expected outcomes

### Coverage Guidelines

1. **Minimum Coverage**: 85% for all modules
2. **Critical Paths**: 100% coverage for security and authentication
3. **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions and error scenarios
4. **Integration Points**: Test all API endpoints and service interactions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed
2. **Mock Issues**: Check that mocks are properly configured
3. **Async Errors**: Use `@pytest.mark.asyncio` for async tests
4. **Coverage Issues**: Verify that all code paths are tested

### Debugging Tests

```bash
# Run tests with verbose output
python -m pytest tests/ -v -s

# Run specific test with debugging
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_services.py::TestSocialMediaScraper::test_scraper_initialization -v -s

# Run tests with coverage and show missing lines
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing
```

## Performance Considerations

### Test Execution Time

- **Unit Tests**: < 30 seconds
- **Integration Tests**: < 2 minutes
- **E2E Tests**: < 5 minutes
- **Full Suite**: < 10 minutes

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Parallel Execution**: Use `pytest-xdist` for parallel test execution
2. **Test Selection**: Run only relevant tests during development
3. **Mock Optimization**: Use efficient mocks to reduce setup time
4. **Database Optimization**: Use in-memory databases for faster tests

## Security Testing

### Security Test Categories

1. **Authentication**: Test login, logout, and session management
2. **Authorization**: Test role-based access control
3. **Input Validation**: Test for injection attacks and malformed input
4. **Data Protection**: Test encryption and data privacy
5. **API Security**: Test API endpoint security

### Security Test Examples

```python
@pytest.mark.security
async def test_authentication_required():
    """Test that protected endpoints require authentication"""
    # Test implementation

@pytest.mark.security
async def test_input_validation():
    """Test input validation against malicious input"""
    # Test implementation

@pytest.mark.security
async def test_data_encryption():
    """Test that sensitive data is properly encrypted"""
    # Test implementation
```

## Contributing to Tests

### Adding New Tests

1. **Follow Naming Convention**: `test_<functionality>_<scenario>`
