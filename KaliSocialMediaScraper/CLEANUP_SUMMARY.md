# Project Cleanup & Documentation Consolidation Summary

## 🧹 Cleanup Completed

### ✅ Cache & Temp Files Removed
- **Python cache files**: All `*.pyc` files and `__pycache__` directories removed
- **Test cache**: `.pytest_cache` and `.mypy_cache` directories removed
- **Database temp files**: `celerybeat-schedule*` and `*.db-*` files removed
- **Temporary directories**: `tmp/` directory removed
- **System files**: `.DS_Store` files removed (where applicable)

### ✅ Duplicate Files Removed
- **Duplicate README files**: Removed from `requirements/`, `config/`, and `database/` directories
- **Duplicate virtual environment**: Removed `venv/` directory (kept `venv311/` as it's more functional)

### ✅ Documentation Consolidated
- **Organized structure**: Created comprehensive `docs/` directory with subdirectories
- **Setup documentation**: Consolidated requirements, configuration, and database guides
- **System requirements**: Added detailed system dependencies including OpenBLAS
- **Implementation plan**: Created detailed plan for tomorrow's development
